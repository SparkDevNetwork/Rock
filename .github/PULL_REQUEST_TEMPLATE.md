## DESCRIPTION

### What does this PR do, or why is it needed?

**In case you are submitting a non bug-fix-PR, we highly recommend you to engage in a PR discussion first.**

There are many factors we consider before accepting a pull request. This includes:
1. Whether or not the Rock system you run is a standard, main-line build. If it is not, there is a lower chance we will accept your request since it may impact some other part of the system you don't regularly use.
2. Features that would be used by less than 80% of Rock organizations, or ones that don't match the goals of Rock.

With the PR discussion we can assess your proposed changes before you start working on it so that we can come up with the best possible approach to it. This may include:
1. Coming up with an alternate approach that does not involve changes to core.
2. Advising how your proposed solution be done in a different way that is more efficient and consistent with the rest of the system.
3. Have one of our core developers make the changes for you. This may be the case if the change involves intricate tasks like an EF migration or something similar.
