## I don't want to read this whole thing I just have a question!!!

> **Note:** Please don't file an issue to ask a question. You'll get faster results by using the resources below.

Rock has an official [Q&A site](https://www.rockrms.com/Rock/Ask), where the community chimes in with helpful advice and best practices.

* [Ask Rock, Q&A](https://www.rockrms.com/Rock/Ask)
* [Rock Documentation](https://www.rockrms.com/Learn)
* [RockU Video Training](https://www.rockrms.com/rocku)

If chat is more your speed, you can join the Rock community on Slack:

* [Join the Rock Conversation on Slack!](https://www.rockrms.com/slack)
    * Even though Slack is a chat service, sometimes it takes several hours for community members to respond &mdash; please be patient!
    * Use the `#general` channel for general questions or discussion about Rock
    * Use the `#troubleshooting` channel for help with specific issues
    * There are many other channels available, check the channel list

## What should I know before I get started?

### License

By contributing your code, you agree to license your contribution under the [Rock Community License Agreement](https://www.rockrms.com/license).  This obviously means you don't get to claim any rights to that code -- but you still have the satisfaction of knowing you contributed to something very cool!

### Rock and Plugins

The power of Rock is that it isn't limited by what the core team provides. Instead the community is able to extend Rock to the furthest reaches of their creativity and abilities. Rock [can be extended](https://www.rockrms.com/Rock/Developer/BookContent/26/26) through plugins, themes, workflow actions, jobs, and external applications added through the Rock Shop or manually.
Because Rock is so extensible, it's possible that a feature you've become accustomed to in Rock, or an issue you're encountering isn’t coming from a bundled feature at all, but rather a plugin you’ve installed.
Contact information for products purchased in the Rock Shop are available on the item page in the store.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Rock. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report) and be sure to fill out the provided template.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* **Check the [Rock Developer Q & A site](http://www.rockrms.com/Rock/Ask/Developing)** for a list of common questions and problems.
* **Determine [which repository the problem should be reported in](#rock-and-packages)**.
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=+is%3Aissue+user%3ASparkDevNetwork)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has, add a reaction to the existing issue instead of opening a new one or commenting.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined [which repository](#rock-and-plugins) your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started Rock, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal, or how you started Rock otherwise. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut or an Rock command, and if so which one?
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. You can use [this tool](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Can you reproduce the problem on a fresh install or the [demo site](http://rock.rocksolidchurchdemo.com/)?**
* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of Rock) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version of Rock?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen?
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
* Include [details about your configuration and environment](#environment-and-diagnostics-information) including **Rock Version**, **Client Culture Setting** and which (if any) [plugins](#rock-and-plugins) you have installed?


### Suggesting Enhancements

The core team is not short on ideas -- we're short on people who can execute ideas. But, if you have an idea
for enhancing Rock that is absolutely amazing we would like to know about it, and if you are a developer, 
we would love to guide you toward successfully executing that idea.

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Rock, including completely new features and  improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion :pencil: and find related suggestions :mag_right:.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check [this list](#before-submitting-an-enhancement-suggestion) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion). If you'd like, you can use [this template](#template-for-submitting-enhancement-suggestions) to structure the information.

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

* **Check if there's already a Rock Shop plugin which provides that enhancement.**
* **Check the [Community Projects List](https://www.rockrms.com/CommunityProjects) to see if developers are already working on that idea.**
* **Check the [plugin-discussion Slack channel](https://rockrms.slack.com/archives/plugin-discussion) and discuss your idea there.**

Based on the outcome of the above the core team may help shape your idea and ask you to implement it as a [Pull Request](#pull-request) provided you've already worked through [Your First Code Contribution](#your-first-code-contribution). 

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

If you are not a developer or cannot hire one to help you execute your idea, we'd still like to know about your enhancement suggestion.  We use a [black book](https://www.rockrms.com/Rock/Ideas) to capture your idea and ask that provide the following details:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the idea**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part of Rock which the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows.
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Rock users and isn't something that can or should be implemented as a [plugin](#rock-and-plugins).
* **List some other sites or applications where this enhancement exists.**
* **Specify which version of Rock you're using.**

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Rock? You can start by looking through these `Claim It` issues:

* [Claim It][claim-it] - issues which should only require a small amount of code, and a test or two.

If you want to read about using Rock or developing plugins for Rock, the [Rock Documentation](https://www.rockrms.com/Learn/Documentation) and  [Developer Guides](https://www.rockrms.com/Developer) are free and available online.

### Pull Requests
The Rock Community loves Pull Requests! In an effort to 'row in the same direction' and minimize wasted development time
on your part and review time on ours, we have implemented the following guidelines for PRs:
1. If you are submitting a PR for a logged Issue / Enhancement request please reference it in your commit (Fixes #1234 or Closes #2445)
2. If your PR is for an enhancement that has not been discussed and approved by the core team please get that approval BEFORE submitting
the request. In fact, this approval should be received before writing the code to limit rework on your part. This will ensure that all code is working into the same vision and direction of the core project.

#### Keep In Mind The Following
* When making changes keep the changes simple (i.e. don't refactor boldly) otherwise the git diff will obscure your change and make it difficult to quickly see the actual change.
* Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible.
* Follow the [ASPX](#c-and-aspx-styleguide), [C#](#c-and-aspx-styleguide), [CSS](#css-styleguide), [JavaScript](#javascript-styleguide), and [SQL](#sql-styleguide) styleguides.
* Remember these [Committing Your Code standards](https://github.com/SparkDevNetwork/Rock/wiki/Committing-Your-Code)
* Use a tool like [GhostDoc](http://submain.com/download/ghostdoc/) to *help* document your methods.
* Try a tool like [CodeMaid](http://www.codemaid.net/) (free, in the Visual Studio store). It will auto-align your code, add brackets to single-line if statements, remove unnecessary whitespace and more.
* Should your pull request require a migration, please exclude the migration from the Rock.Migration project, but submit it in your
pull request. Please add a note to your pull request that provides a heads up that a migration file is present. 

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

## Additional Notes

### Issue and Pull Request Labels

This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests. Most labels are used across all `SparkDevNetwork` repositories, but some are specific to `SparkDevNetwork/Rock`.

[GitHub search](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) makes it easy to use labels for finding groups of issues or pull requests you're interested in. For example, you might be interested in [open issues across `SparkDevNetwork/Rock` and all Spark Development Network-owned packages which are labeled as bugs, but still need to be reliably reproduced][search-rock-repo-label-status-needs-info] or perhaps [open pull requests in `SparkDevNetwork/Rock` which haven't been reviewed yet][search-rock-repo-label-status-review-needed]. To help you find issues and pull requests, each label is listed with search links for finding open items with that label in `SparkDevNetwork/Rock` only and also across all Rock repositories. We  encourage you to read about [other search filters](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) which will help you write more focused queries.

The labels are loosely grouped by their purpose, but it's not required that every issue have a label from every group or that an issue can't have more than one label from the same group.

Please open an issue on `SparkDevNetwork/Rock` if you have suggestions for new labels, and if you notice some labels are missing on some repositories, then please open an issue on that repository.
