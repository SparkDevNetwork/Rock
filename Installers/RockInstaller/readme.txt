The files in this directory are used to install the Rock RMS.

CREATING INSTALLER ZIP FILE
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>


___ 1. Download the source from the GitHub release tag

___ 2. Build solution in Visual Studio (IMPORTANT: build in Release mode) After downloading you may
       need to make the RockWeb project the startup project.

___ 3. Edit web.config

        * Set RunJobsInIISContext = true
        * Turn off debug <compilation debug="false"

___ 4. Delete all the files out of ~/App_Data/packages

___ 5. Copy the Rock.x.y.z.nupkg file from
       https://github.com/SparkDevNetwork/Rock-UpdatePackageBuilder/tree/master/InstallerArtifacts
       to the App_Data/Packages folder.  Remove any earlier versions of the Rock.*.nupkg file.
       (NOTE: All these Nuget packages can be 'empty' stub packages.)
       
___ 6. Copy the RockUpdate-X-Y-Z.x.y.z.nupkg file from
       https://github.com/SparkDevNetwork/Rock-UpdatePackageBuilder/tree/master/InstallerArtifacts
       to the App_Data/Packages folder.
       (NOTE: All these Nuget packages can be 'empty' stub packages.)
       
___ 7. Also copy any other RockUpdate-X-Y-*.x.y.*.nupkg packages that a later version of Rock may
       depend on.  For example, Rock version 1.5.2 had a dependency on Rock 1.5.0.  Therefore the
       1.5.1 Installer had to include:
       (NOTE: All these Nuget packages can be 'empty' stub packages.)
       
       * Rock.1.5.1.nupkg 
       * RockUpdate-1-5-1.1.5.1.nupkg
       * RockUpdate-1-5-0.1.5.0.nupkg
       
___ 8. Delete the following files from the RockWeb directory

       * .gitignore (do a search as there are files in several directory)
        *.pdb (do a search as there are several files )
        * Settings.StyleCop
        * .editorconfig

___ 9. Zip up the RockWeb directory (so that all it's subfolders are the root of the zip)

___ 10. Rename zip file 'rock-install-latest.zip'

___ 11. Move copy of zip to ./Installers/RockInstaller/Install Versions/vX.Y.Z/ so that it  
       will be in source control

___ 12. Overwrite with snapshot zip file to Azure Blog storage (rockrms/install/<version>/Data)
        Note the <version> label is the installer version not the Rock version. This should not
        be incremented except when the installer scripts get updated.

CREATING SQL FILE
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>

___ 1. Add a web.ConnectionStrings.config to the downloaded project above and give it a 
       fresh database name.

___ 2. Run 'update-database' in Visual Studio package manager so that a new database is made.

___ 3. Open SQL Server Manager (you must use SQL Server Manager version 2014).

___ 4. Run the SQL below to purge old migrations out (this greatly reduces the size of the SQL script)
       UPDATE [__MigrationHistory] 
       SET [Model] = 0x
       WHERE [MigrationId] != (SELECT MAX(MigrationId) FROM [__MigrationHistory])

___ 5. Right-click on the new database and select 'Tasks > Generate Scripts'

___ 6. Click 'Next' until you see the screen with the 'Advanced' button.

___ 7. Save the file as 'sql-install.sql'

___ 8. Click the 'Advanced' button and change the setting for 'Types of data to script' to 
       'schema and data', and change the 'Script Triggers' option to 'True'.

___ 9. Click 'Next' then 'Finished'

___ 10. Open the SQL file and make the following edits:
     ___ * delete from the start of the file to the beginning of the first comment of the first stored proc
     ___ * remove the following six lines from the end of the script
              USE [master]
              GO
              ALTER DATABASE [RockRMS_NewDbName] SET  READ_WRITE 
              GO
              USE [RockRMS_NewDbName]
              GO
              
     ___ * Remove the following strings from the file in the order below:
            'TEXTIMAGE_ON [PRIMARY]'
            'ON [PRIMARY]'

         * The script will have issues inserting into the [AttributeValue] table with its persisted
           computed column so:
       ___ 1. Remove the line from the create table for [AttributeValue] that is SIMILAR TO this (copy it for later):
                [ValueAsNumeric]  AS (case when len([value])<(100) then case when isnumeric([value])=(1) AND NOT [value] like '%[^0-9.]%' then TRY_CAST([value] AS [numeric](38,10))  end  end) PERSISTED;

       ___ 2. Search for the lines
              SET IDENTITY_INSERT [dbo].[AttributeValue] OFF
              SET ANSI_PADDING OFF
         
           ... and place the lines below under it using the copy you made earlier...
              SET ANSI_NULLS ON
              GO
              SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON
              GO
              SET ANSI_PADDING ON
              GO
              ALTER TABLE [AttributeValue] ADD
             		[ValueAsNumeric]  AS (case when len([value])<(100) then case when isnumeric([value])=(1) AND NOT [value] like '%[^0-9.]%' then TRY_CAST([value] AS [numeric](38,10))  end  end) PERSISTED;

       ___ 3. Remove the following "WITH" options from any "CREATE SPATIAL INDEX" statements (to avoid problems with Azure SQL V2):
              PAD_INDEX = OFF,
              SORT_IN_TEMPDB = OFF,
              ALLOW_ROW_LOCKS = ON,
              ALLOW_PAGE_LOCKS = ON

___ 11. Zip the file into a new file named 'sql-latest.zip'

___ 12. Move copy of zip to ./Installers/RockInstaller/Install Versions/vX.Y.Z/ so that 
        it will be in source control

___ 13. Overwrite with snapshot zip file to Azure Blog storage
        (rockrms/install/<version>/Data)

___ 14. Test a brand new install on various web hosting providers.

___ 15. Commit the additions made to ./Installers/RockInstaller/Install Versions/vX.Y.Z/ into the develop branch.
