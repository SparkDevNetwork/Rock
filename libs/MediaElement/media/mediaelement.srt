HTML5 &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt; was supposed to be awesome, powerful, and fun.

1
00:00:04 --> 00:00:07
But browser vendors couldn't agree on a codec

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:10
and older browsers don't support &lt;video&gt; at all.

3
00:00:10 --> 00:00:12
This means &lt;video src="myfile.mp4" /&gt; doesn't work ...

4
00:00:12 --> 00:00:14
until now.

5
00:00:14 --> 00:00:18
Introducing MediaElement.js, an HTML5 &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt; player

6
00:00:18 --> 00:00:21
that looks and works the same in every browser (even iPhone and Android).

7
00:00:21 --> 00:00:24
For older browsers, it has custom Flash and Silverlight plugins 

8
00:00:24 --> 00:00:27
that fully replicate the HTML5 MediaElement API

9
00:00:27 --> 00:00:30
so you can build a consistent control UI using just HTML and CSS.

10
00:00:30 --> 00:00:33
MediaElement.js even supports newer standards 

11
00:00:33 --> 00:00:36
like the &lt;track&gt; element that enables the subtitles you're reading right now.

12
00:00:36 --> 00:00:39
The subtitles can even be translated into any language using Google's Translation API.

13
00:00:39 --> 00:00:42
As a bonus, the Flash and Silverlight fallbacks allow you to use FLV and WMV files.

14
00:00:42 --> 00:00:45
Hope you like it.
