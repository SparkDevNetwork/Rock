# Lake Pointe Files 
This directory contains files created/used by the Lake Pointe Development team but are not a part of a Rock/Visual Studio project.  


## Adding Files

 - Copy files to the appropriate sub-directory. This can be done either through GitLab's web interface or through your local repository.
 - Commit changes
 - If you are working from your local repository push your branch to GitLab.
 - Create a [Merge Request](https://gitlab.com/lakepointe/Rock/merge_requests) intothe current base/master branch in GitLab.
 - Merge in the request or have another team member review the change and merge the request.
 - If not done previously, delete the source branch (i.e. your feature branch).
