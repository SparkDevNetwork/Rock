        When adjusting the grades, the first thing to keep in mind is that Rock only stores the year that someone graduates from the educational system.
        In the US, that''s their high school graduation. Rock dynamically calculates a person''s grade by:
        
        <ol>
            <li>
                Comparing the current date to their graduation year which provides an offset in years 
                (Rock also uses the Grade Transition Date Global Attribute to help determine the start of the school year).
            </li>
            <li>
                The year offset from step 1 is then compared with the grade defined values below. The first Defined Value 
                (grade) whose value is greater than or equal to the offset is selected. For systems that have one grade for each year, this is a simple 
                setup. The last grade (senior year in the US) would have a value of 0, the next (junior) a value of 1, etc. For systems where a grade 
                spans multiple years, you would ""skip"" years.  For example, to have a Middle School
                grade level instead of separate 7th and 8th grades, you would set the Value
                of Middle School to 5, and the next higher grade level (Freshman) to 3.
            </li>
        </ol>
