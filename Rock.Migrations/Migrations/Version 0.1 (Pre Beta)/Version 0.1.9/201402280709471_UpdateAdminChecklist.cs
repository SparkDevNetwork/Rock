<p> While Rock ships with the ability to integrate with several geocoding services we recommend using the Bing Maps API as they generously allow you to geocode addresses for free. In order to configure this you will need to obtain a free license key. Follow these directions to obtain and save your key:

<ul>
    <li>Goto the <a href=""https://www.bingmapsportal.com/"">Bing Maps Portal</a>.</li>
    <li>Sign in using a Microsoft Account or create a new account.</li> 
    <li>Select ""Create or View Keys"" from the menu on the left side of the page.</li>
    <li>Create a new key. Choose ""Basic"" for the key type and ""Public Website"" or ""Non-Profit"" for the application type (depending on what fits your organization).</li>
    <li>Input your key under <span class=""navigation-tip"">Admin Tools > System Settings > Geocoding Services > Bing</span>.
    
</ul>

</p>

<p>
For more information on geocoding, including other geocoding services that are available, see the <a href=""http://www.rockrms.com/Rock/BookContent/9#geocodingservices"">Admin Hero Guide</a>.
