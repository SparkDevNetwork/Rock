At an average age of 56, they continue to work in a variety of professional/technical and white-collar professions. Although mean income for the group puts them squarely in the middle class, the market values of their homes reflect the high cost of housing in many bigger cities. A wide income range is represented, and most have accrued net worth, enough so to rank the cluster 16th of all the clusters.

Not typically readers of traditional media other than newspaper classifieds, they might use the Internet for news and sports information, as well as looking for a new job. Although many enjoy time alone, members of this ethnically diverse group also like attending movies of various genres, watching syndicated and network TV shows and going out to eat (pizza).','These mid-30s to mid-50s consumers (average age 41) are mostly single and have no children in the home.
