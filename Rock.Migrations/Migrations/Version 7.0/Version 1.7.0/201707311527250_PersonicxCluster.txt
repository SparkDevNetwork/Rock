They like following financial markets but are not especially involved.

At an average age of 56, they continue to work in a variety of professional/technical and white-collar professions. Although mean income for the group puts them squarely in the middle class, the market values of their homes reflect the high cost of housing in many bigger cities. A wide income range is represented, and most have accrued net worth, enough so to rank the cluster 16th of all the clusters.
