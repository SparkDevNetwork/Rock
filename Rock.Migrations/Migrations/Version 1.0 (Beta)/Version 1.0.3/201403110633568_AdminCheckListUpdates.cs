<ul>
<li>Do you have lots of military?  Maybe you want to track ''Deployment Date'' and care for the family that remains home.</li>
<li>Do you have a diverse congregation?  Maybe you want to track ''Languages Spoken'' by people within your congregation. </li>
<li>Does your ministry seem to always be handing out t-shirts?  Store an individual''s t-shirt preference.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: When you create a new category of person attributes you''ll want to add that new category to the <span class=""navigation-tip"">Person Profile</span> page to allow for entry/edit. To do this go to any individual''s detail page and add a new ''Attributes Value'' block to the zone you''d like it to appear.</p>
