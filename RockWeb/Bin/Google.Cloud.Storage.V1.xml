            Modifying bucket labels involves reading the bucket metadata in one request,

            to ensure that the bucket hasn't changed between the two requests. If the metageneration
            *has* changed, the overall operation can be retried from the start. This property indicates
            the number of retries, so it has a minimum value of 0.
