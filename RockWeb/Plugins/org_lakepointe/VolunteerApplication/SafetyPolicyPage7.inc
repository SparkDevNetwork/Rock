<h3><center>PERSONAL CONDUCT CODE</center></h3>
<p>As an individual representing Lakepointe Church, it’s important to demonstrate a life guided by Jesus. Leaders should “always try to maintain a clear conscience before God and all people” (Acts 24:16). Just as Paul declared, “Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ” (1 Corinthians 11:1), leaders should strive to point every individual toward Jesus. A leader’s words and actions, whether in public or private, should be consistent with the teaching of the Bible. As followers of Christ, it is our desire to “put no stumbling block in anyone’s path, so that our ministry will not be discredited” (1 Corinthians 10:23-33; 2 Corinthians 6:3; Romans 14:13-19).</p>
<p>While no person is perfect, there is a difference between choosing a lifestyle that is not consistent with biblical teaching and occasionally stumbling in your daily walk with God. If an individual will not submit to the authority of Christ by choosing to continue in any behavior, relationship or activity not consistent with the teaching of Scripture, he or she should not accept or continue to hold a volunteer position at Lakepointe Church (Mark 7:20-23; 1 Corinthians 6:15-20; 1 Timothy 1:8-11; Colossians 3:8).</p>
