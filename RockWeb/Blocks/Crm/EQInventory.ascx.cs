<h2>Welcome to the EQ Inventory Assessment</h2>
<p>
    {{ Person.NickName }}, we encounter emotions every day: our own and those of the people around us.
    This assessment measures your developed skills in two areas: understanding your emotions and
    understanding the emotions of others.
</p>
<p>
    For best results with this assessment, picture a setting such as the workplace, at home or with
    friends, and keep that same setting in mind as you answer all the questions. Your responses may
    be different in different circumstances.
</p>
<p>
    Don’t spend too much time thinking about your answer. Usually, your first responses is your most
    natural. Since there are no right or wrong answers, just go with your instinct.

<p>
    {{ Person.NickName }}, here are your emotional intelligence results. This is a snapshot
    in time and may change through intentional effort and practice. You will rank high, medium
    or low in each of the following six areas.
</p>

<h3 id='eq-SelfAwareness'>Self Awareness</h3>
<p>
    Self-Awareness is being aware of what emotions you are experiencing and why you
    are experiencing them. This skill is demonstrated in real time. In other words,
    when you are in the midst of a discussion or even a disagreement with someone else,
    ask yourself these questions:
    <ul>
        <li>Are you aware of what emotions you are experiencing?</li>
        <li>Are you aware of why you are experiencing these emotions?</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<blockquote>
    Your responses to the items on the Self Awareness scale indicate the score for the
    ability to be aware of your own emotions is equal to or better than {{ SelfAwareness }}%
    of those who completed this instrument.
</blockquote>

<h3 id='eq-selfregulating'>Self-Regulating</h3>
<p>
    Self-Regulating is appropriately expressing your emotions in the context of the relationships
    around you. This doesn’t indicate suppressing emotions; rather the ability to express your
    emotions appropriately. Healthy human beings experience a full range of emotions and these are
    important for family, friends, and co-workers to understand. Self-Regulating is learning to
    tell others what you are feeling in the moment.

</blockquote>


<h3 id='eq-othersawareness'>Others-Awareness</h3>
<p>
    Others-Awareness is being aware of what emotions others are experiencing around you and
    why they are experiencing these emotions. As with understanding your own emotions, this
    skill is knowing in real time what another person is experiencing. This skill involves
    reading cues to their emotional state through their eyes, facial expressions, body
    posture, the tone of voice and many other ways.

    ability to be aware of others emotions is equal to or better than {{ OthersAwareness }}%

</blockquote>


<h3 id='eq-othersregulating'>Others-Regulating</h3>
<p>
    Others-Regulating is helping those around you express their emotions appropriately
    in the context of your relationship with them. This skill centers on helping others
    know what emotions they are experiencing and then asking questions or giving them
    permission to freely and appropriately express their emotions in the context of
    your relationship.

</blockquote>

<h3 id='eq-problemsolving'>EQ in Problem Solving</h3>
<p>
    EQ in Problem Solving identifies how proficient you are at using emotions to solve
    problems. This skill requires first being aware of what emotions are involved in
    the problem and what is the source of those emotions. It also includes helping
    others (and yourself) express those emotions appropriate in the context of
    the situation.

    the ability to use emotions in resolving problems is equal to or better than {{ EQinProblemSolving }}%

</blockquote>


<h3 id='eq-understress'>EQ Under Stress</h3>
<p>
    EQ Under Stress identifies how capable you are of keeping high EQ under high-stress
    moments; which is particularly challenging. This skill requires highly developed
    Self- and Others-Awareness to understand the impact of the current stress. It also
    involves being able to articulate the appropriate emotions under pressure which
    may be different from articulating them when not under stress.
