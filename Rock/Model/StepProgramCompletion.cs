       We originally planned to try to track Step Program "Engagement" but this became dificult to accurately
       determine which steps should be considered part of an active, on-going program.  That is because a 
       person could have multiple attempts at one step over several years and they really shouldn't necessarily
       be considered part of the current "engagement".  Therefore, we changed this to track 'completed' 
       engagements using a simple rule described below.
