           AlertType drives the logic of how sensitivity values are used. (See notes and logic here https://github.com/SparkDevNetwork/Rock/blob/6dacabe84dcaf041450c3bc075164c7580151390/Rock/Jobs/GivingAutomation.cs#L1602)

           Follow-Up uses sensitivity to look for 'worse than usual':
               - Gifts with amounts that are significantly smaller than usual. For example, a $50 gift for somebody that usually gives $300 a week.

           Gratitude uses sensitivity to look for 'better than usual':
               - Gifts with amounts that are significantly larger than usual. For example, a $1200 gift for somebody that usually gives $300 a week.

           In both cases, a positive value for sensitivity should be used.
           A negative sensitivity could be entered if they really wanted to, but it'll do weird things such as express gratitude for a gift over $180 for a person that normally gives $200.
