                Issue #1:
                ---------
                The iCal.NET library we use to manage iCalendar events has a known issue where recurring events can
                incorrectly-generate an extra occurrence for the specified `DtStart` date/time value, even if:

                    1) `DtStart` doesn't qualify as a recurrence (for events with recurrence rules)
                    2) `DtStart` doesn't appear in the list of specific dates (for events with recurrence dates)

                https://github.com/rianjs/ical.net/issues/431

                Furthermore, the iCal.NET library is no longer maintained, so it's clear we cannot count on this
                issue being fixed on their end any time soon.

                Workaround #1:
                --------------
                The `CalendarEvent` Type is an implementation of the `RecurringComponent` Type, which has a
                `EvaluationIncludesReferenceDate` property that dictates whether to add the `DtStart` date/time
                value as an `Occurrence` in the returned set of occurrences. Simply put, we ultimately need to set
                this property to `false`. But the problem is that it's a readonly property, with the `CalendarEvent`
                Type setting it to `true` upon instantiation. Luckily, the base `RecurringComponent` Type sets this
                property to `false` upon instantiation.

                All we need to do is create a new instance of `RecurringComponent`, copy all of the `CalendarEvent`
                instance's property values over (using their handy `CopyFrom()` method) and get a new, refined set
                of occurrences. We can then compare the two `Occurrence` sets and remove those occurrences from the
                former set that don't appear in the latter. The reason we don't want to simply RETURN the latter
                occurrence set directly, is because the iCal.NET library attaches the underlying Type instance to
                each occurrence's `Source` property, and in local testing, returning an occurrence set with
                `RecurringComponent` source objects can lead to unhandled exceptions being thrown by some downstream
                Rock processes; better to play it safe and return the same object graph structure that's
                historically been returned from this method.

                Issue #2:
                ---------
                Related to Issue #1, events having recurrence rules that include a specified count (i.e. "End after n
                occurrences"), will incorrectly count the `DtStart` occurrence as one of the "n" occurrences, which can
                lead to the final, correct occurrence being excluded from the returned set (because the library thinks
                it has already returned enough occurrences, since it incorrectly included the `DtStart` date/time value
                as an occurrence.

                Workaround #2:
                --------------
                We'll simply increase each recurrence rule count by 1 before getting the first ['CalendarEvent`] set of
                occurrences, then reduce each recurrence rule count back to the original value before getting the second
                [`RecurringComponent`] set of occurrences. This will ensure that the final, correct occurrence doesn't
                get chopped from the set, and will be returned from this method.

                Reason: Recurring Schedules sometimes return incorrect occurrences.
                https://github.com/SparkDevNetwork/Rock/issues/5980

            // Temporarily increase each recurrence rule count by 1, so we don't accidentally exclude the last, correct
            // occurrence from the final set.
            var rulesWithCounts = iCalEvent.RecurrenceRules?.Where( rr => rr.Count > 0 ).ToList();
