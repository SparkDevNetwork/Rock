                SET [Documentation]=N'<p>
    This shortcode returns a static map (think Google Map as an image) based on parameters you provide. Let''s look at a simple example.
</p>

<pre>{[ googlestaticmap center:''10451 W Palmeras Dr Sun City, AZ 85373-2000'' zoom:''12'' ]}
{[ endgooglestaticmap ]}</pre>

<p>
    Here''s we''re showing a simple map centered around the address we provided at a reasonable zoom level. Note that you could 
    also provide the center point as a lat/long if you prefer.
</p>

<p>
So, what about markers, yep you can do that too. Notice when you use makers you don''t have to provide a center point or zoom.
</p>

<pre>{[ googlestaticmap ]}
    [[ marker location:''33.640705,-112.280198'' ]] [[ endmarker ]]
    [[ marker location:''1 Cardinals Dr, Glendale, AZ 85305'' ]] [[ endmarker ]]
{[ endgooglestaticmap ]}</pre>

<p>
    Note here we provided both a lat/long and a street address. Either is just fine. With the markers, you can also 
    provide it other options. Here are your options:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>location</strong> – The location (address) of the pin.</li>
    <li><strong>color</strong> – The color of the pin, can be a basic color from the list below or a 24-bit color in the pattern of 0xFFFFFF.</li>
        (black, brown, green, purple, yellow, blue, gray, orange, red, white).
    <li><strong>size</strong> – The size of the pin (valid values include: tiny,mid,small)</li>
    <li><strong>label</strong> - The letter or number that you want on the pin.</li>
    <li><strong>icon</strong> – The url to the png file to use for the pin icon.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Now that we have the pins taken care of let''s look at the other options you can place on the shortcut:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>returnurl</strong> (false) – By default the returned map will be in an image tag with a div to wrap it. Setting returnurl to ''true'' 
        will return just the URL (say for adding it as a background image).</li>
    <li><strong>width</strong> (100%) – The image will be added to a responsive div. The setting allows you to set the width of the div to a percent or px.</li>
    <li><strong>imagesize</strong> – The size of the image to get from the Google API. If you are using the free API you are limited to 640x640, though you can actually double 
        that if you set the scale = 2. If you buy the premium plan that size goes up to 2048x2048.</li>
    <li><strong>maptype</strong> (roadmap) – This determines the type of map to return. Valid values include roadmap, satellite, hybrid, and terrain.</li>
    <li><strong>scale</strong> (1) – This effects the number of pixels that are returned (usually used for creating high DPI images (aka retina). You can use this though to 
        double the size of the 640px limit. Valid values are 1 or 2 or 4 (4 requires the premium plan).</li>
    <li><strong>zoom</strong> (optional if used with markers) – The zoom level of the map. This must be value between 1-20. Below is a rough idea of the scales:
        <ul>
            <li>1 = world</li>
            <li>5 = continent</li>
            <li>10 = city</li>
            <li>15 = streets</li>
            <li>20 = buildings</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    <li><strong>center</strong> (optional if used with markers) – The center point of the map. Can be either a street address or lat/long.</li>
    <li><strong>format</strong> (png8) – The format type of the image that is returned. Valid values include png8, png32, gif, jpg, jpg-baseline.</li>
    <li><strong>style</strong> (optional) – The returned map can be styled in an infinite (or close to) number of ways. See the Google Static Map documentation for 
        details (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/static-maps/styling).</li>

    Adding a Google map to your page always starts out sounding easy… until… you get to the details. Soon the whole day is wasted and you don''t have much to 
    show. This shortcode makes it easy to add responsive Google Maps to your site. Let''s start with a simple example and work our way to more complex use cases.
</p>

<p>
    Note: Do to this javascript requirements of this shortcode you will need to do a full page reload before changes to the 
    shortcode appear on your page.

    [[ marker location:''33.640705,-112.280198'' ]] [[ endmarker ]]

<p>
    In the example above we mapped a single point to our map. Pretty easy, but not very helpful. We can add additional points by providing more markers.
</p>

<pre>{[ googlemap ]}
     [[ marker location:''33.640705,-112.280198'' ]] [[ endmarker ]]
     [[ marker location:'' 33.52764, -112.262571'' ]] [[ endmarker ]]
{[ endgooglemap ]}</pre>

<p>
    Ok… we''re getting there, but what if we wanted titles and information windows for our markers, oh and custom markers 
    too? You can provide optional parameters for each marker as shown below.
</p>

<pre>[[ marker location:''latitude,longitude'' title:''My Title'' icon:''icon url'' ]] info window content [[ endmarker ]]</pre>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<pre>{[ googlemap ]}
    [[ marker location:''33.640705,-112.280198'' title:''Spark Global Headquarters'']]
        &lt;strong&gt;Spark Global Headquarters&lt;/strong&gt;
        It''s not as grand as it sounds.&lt;br&gt;

    [[ endmarker ]]
    [[ marker location:''33.52764, -112.262571'']][[ endmarker ]]
{[ endgooglemap ]}</pre>

<p></p><p>
    Note: A list of great resources for custom map markers is below:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href=""http://map-icons.com/"">Map Icons</a></li>
    <li><a href=""https://mapicons.mapsmarker.com/"">Map Icons Collection</a></li>
    <li><a href=""https://github.com/Concept211/Google-Maps-Markers"">Google Maps Markers</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
    There are several other parameters for you to use to control the options on your map. They include:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>height</strong> (600px) – The height of the map.</li>
    <li><strong>width</strong> (100%) – The responsive width of the map.</li>
    <li><strong>zoom</strong> (optional) – The zoom level of the map. Note when two or more points are provided the map will auto zoom to place all of the points on the map. The range of the zoom scale is 1 (the furthest out, largest) to 20 (the closest, smallest). The approximate zoom levels are: 
    <ul>
        <li>1 = world</li>
        <li>5 = continent</li>
        <li>10 = city</li>
        <li>15 = streets</li>
        <li>20 = buildings</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>center</strong> (optional) – The center point on the map. If you do not provide a center a default will be calculated based on the points given.</li>
    <li><strong>maptype</strong> (roadmap) – The type of map to display. The options are ‘roadmap'', ‘hybrid'', ‘satellite'' or ‘terrain''.</li>
    <li><strong>showzoom</strong> (true) – Should the zoom control be displayed.</li>
    <li><strong>showstreetview</strong> (false) – Should he StreetView control be displayed.</li>
    <li><strong>showfullscreen</strong> (true) – Should the control to show the map full screen be displayed.</li>
    <li><strong>showmapttype</strong> (false) – Should the control to change the map type be shown.</li>
    <li><strong>markeranimation</strong> (none) – The marker animation type. Options include: ''none'', ‘bounce'' (markers bounce continuously) or ''drop'' (markers drop in).</li>
    <li><strong>scrollwheel</strong> (true) – Determines if the scroll wheel should control the zoom level when the mouse is over the map.</li>
    <li><strong>draggable</strong> (true) – Determines if the mouse should be allowed to drag the center point of the map (allow the map to be moved).</li>
    <li><strong>gesturehandling</strong> (cooperative) – Determines how the map should scroll. The default is not to scroll with the scroll wheel. Often times a person is using the scroll-wheel to scroll down the page. If the cursor happens to scroll over the map the map will then start zooming in. In ‘cooperative'' mode this will not occur and the guest will need to use [ctlr] + scroll to zoom the map. If you would like to disable this setting set the mode to ''greedy''.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    As you can see there are a lot of options in working with your map. You can also style your map by changing the colors. You do this by providing 
    the styling information in a separate [[ style ]] section. The styling settings for Google Maps is not pretty to look at or configure for that matter. Luckily, there 
    are several sites that allow you to download preconfigured map styles. Two of the best are called <a href=""https://snazzymaps.com"">SnazzyMaps</a> and 
    <a href=""https://mapstyle.withgoogle.com"">Map Style</a>. Below is an example showing how to add styling to your maps.

    Adding parallax effects (when the background image of a section scrolls at a different speed than the rest of the page) can greatly enhance the 
    aesthetics of the page. Until now, this effect has taken quite a bit of CSS know how to achieve. Now it’s as simple as:
</p>
<pre>{[ parallax image:''http://cdn.wonderfulengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/star-wars-wallpaper-4.jpg'' contentpadding:''20px'' ]}
    &lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;
{[ endparallax ]}</pre>

<p>  
    This shortcode takes the content you provide it and places it into a div with a parallax background using the image you provide in the ''image'' 
    parameter. As always, there are several parameters.
</p>
    
<ul>
    <li><strong>image</strong> (required) – A valid URL to the image that should be used as the background.</li><li><b>height</b> (200px) – The minimum height of the content. This is useful if you want your section to not have any 
    content, but instead be just the parallax image.</li>
    <li><strong>videourl</strong> - This is the URL to use if you''d like a video background.</li>
    <li><strong>speed</strong> (50) – the speed that the background should scroll. The value of 0 means the image will be fixed in place, the value of 100 would make the background scroll quick up as the page scrolls down, while the value of -100 would scroll quickly in the opposite direction.</li>
    <li><strong>zindex</strong> (1) – The z-index of the background image. Depending on your design you may need to adjust the z-index of the parallax image. </li>
    <li><strong>position</strong> (center center) - This is analogous to the background-position css property. Specify coordinates as top, bottom, right, left, center, or pixel values (e.g. -10px 0px). The parallax image will be positioned as close to these values as possible while still covering the target element.</li>
