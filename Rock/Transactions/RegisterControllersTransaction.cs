    We changed this back to use Rock.Transactions.RegisterControllersTransaction instead.
    This is because RestControllerService.RegisterControllers has a dependancy on having
    all the Routes configured. The Bus message approach (Rock.Tasks.RegisterRestControllers)
    would sometimes result in RegisterControllers happening before Routes would be configured,
    which would cause RestController and RestAction records to get deleted.
