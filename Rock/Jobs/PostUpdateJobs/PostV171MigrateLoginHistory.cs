                5/6/2025 - JPH

                When we originally introduced the new [HistoryLogin] table, we migrated all login-specific [History]
                records (where [Verb] = 'LOGIN') over to the new table, and deleted them from the old table. After
                further investigation, we realized that Rock was adding 'LOGIN' records far too often, making the login
                history far too noisy and therefore, not very helpful. This was because non-login records were being
                falsely reported as logins (e.g. Whenever Rock would start and find a preexisting auth cookie / the
                mobile app would start and issue a "launch packet", a 'LOGIN' record was added, even though these aren't
                true "login" events).

                We've since decided to only create [HistoryLogin] records in the new table when an individual truly logs
                in (when providing a username + password, using passwordless login, going through an OIDC flow, Etc.).
                Furthermore, to clean up the previous migration of noisy data, we've decided to:

                    1. TRUNCATE any preexisting records from the [HistoryLogin] table, so only true logins will be
                       present moving forward. This will only affect the Spark + Triumph sites and any super early beta
                       testers (the Rock community - in general - will not be affected by this step, as Rock v17.1 has
                       not yet been released).
                    2. DELETE - without migrating - any preexisting login-specific [History] records (where [Verb] = 'LOGIN'),
                       since we have no way of differentiating between "true" and "noisy" past records. We'd rather start
                       with a clean and helpful slate than bring over unhelpful mountains of data.

                Another benefit of this precision approach is that the performance of the new Login History block will
                be greatly improved, as it will need to load and display far fewer records.

                Reason: Implement revised strategy for what it means to "migrate" login history.
